# Life Calendar
CS465P Final Project

Life Calendar (somewhat ironically) is a form of death clock that allows users to enter certain demographic information after logging in. The information is saved to a database so the user need not enter it on return visits. The app will use the information provided to calculate the average lifespan of the user in weeks and display a grid of boxes where each box represents one week. Filled boxes represent weeks past and empty boxes represent weeks future. The user will be able to make adjustments to their data and the app will adjust to reflect that.

Life Calendar hopes to give users an accurate scale of their life, for better or worse.
